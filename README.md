# Introduction to Git

This repository is based several sources:
- a coursera course on automation with python from google.
- youtube video of Corey Schafer

The files mentioned below have been extended based on other courses from datacamp and linuxacademy.  

It contains a python file, a notebook and probably most important are the git_local_cheat_sheet, git_remote_cheat_sheet file that bundles important commands that are useful. The cheat sheets are based on the video's from the google course

It is important to NEVER REMOVE THIS REPOSITORY. In another repository I have a simple project that has some basic unit tests using pytest.

This repo will be populated with lots of fancy checks

Now it is time for :coffee: or a :banana:. Maybe even a :sandwich:
